 /* One simple application to retrieve and parse different JSON arrays:
 
 books, categories and books in categories


* Use of Bootstrap, jQuery and libraries such as animate.css and font-awesome

* The ideas is to give the look & feel of how to display the JSON data that's why I choose Bootstrap to wrap it up in a responsive layout

* I use the hover effect to display all the detailed info of each array within the categories

 * All nulls were removed in the jSON array so they don't appear in the outcome.

* A jQuery accordion was used in the interaction of the buttons.

* Version: 1.0
