 /* One simple application to retrieve and parse different JSON arrays:
 
 books, categories and books in categories


* Use of Bootstrap, jQuery and libraries such as animate.css and font-awesome

* The first approach was to think of a plug-in called JSON CONTENT IMPORTER to integrate it with WP

* but it required special premium addons to retrieve different types of data

* so I decided for the jQuery ajax method to get the JSON arrays

* Version: 1.0
